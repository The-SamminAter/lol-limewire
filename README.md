I guess it's me seeing how far I can go with bash, as it's my favourite language. I find it interesting how it's possible to reach/do the same things in different languages, to an extent at least. 

Now, bash is command-line language/interface, so it's not comparable to regular languages for practical every-day use, right? But, as R0wDrunner put perfectly, "your solutions are sometimes weird as fuck", and indeed, this is one of those (weird solutions).
