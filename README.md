# lol, limewire
A personal project, I don't really know what it is yet.

## stage-1.sh is a complete mess of mainly commentary and a bit of non-functioning code

I guess it's me seeing how far I can go with bash, as that is currently my main (and favourite) language. I find it interesting how it is possible to reach/do the same things in different languages, to an extent at least. 

Now, bash is command-line language/interface, so it's not comparable to C or Swift for practical every-day use, right? But, as R0wDrunner put perfectly, "your solutions are sometimes weird as fuck", and indeed, this is one of those (weird solutions).

There is a degree of probability that either a part of it or it as a whole don't work

Also I don't know the degree of probability


I strongly suggest not running this on a used/important mac

Some of this may be broken with Catalina

I named this lol, limewire because the song is stuck in my head.
