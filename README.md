# lol, limewire
A personal project, I don't really know what it is yet.

I guess it's me seeing how far I can go with bash, as that is currently my main language. I find it interesting how it is possible to reach/do the same things in different languages, to an extent at least.

There is a degree of probability that either a part of it or it as a whole don't work

Also I don't know the degree of probability


I strongly suggest not running this on a used/important mac

Some of this may be broken with Catalina

I named this lol, limewire because the song is stuck in my head.

## Stage 1
Stage one pretty much replicates itself and makes sure that it gets ran

To do:
- [ ] Check if the/this/a script is already present in the app folder

  - [ ] Deal with the executable
  - [ ] Deal with the Info.plist
  - [ ] Deal with neither
- [ ] If applicable, run the executable
  - [ ] Add `-no` variable to stop that from happening
- [ ] Check if the LaunchAgent is created properly
- [ ] Check if the LaunchAgent runs properly
- [ ] Decide on and create trigger for Stage 2 start
- [ ] Decide and/or generate placement of Stage 2
- [ ] Network monitors
  - [ ] Add newest Little Snitch killing
  - [ ] Add LuLu killing
